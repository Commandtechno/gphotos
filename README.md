# googlemirror

Google used to host a Google Photos go client library at
https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client/blob/master/photoslibrary/v1/photoslibrary-gen.go

This no longer appears to exist, it [was announced](https://code-review.googlesource.com/c/google-api-go-client/+/39951) by library maintainers, so we are mirroring own local copy in order to be able to call Google Photos API.
